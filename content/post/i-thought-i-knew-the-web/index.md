# I thought I knew the web
<time>2018-04-13</time>

Like many others recently, I am questioning my use of social media. The whole scandal around Cambridge Analytica and Facebook is systemic and hardly surprising, but what _is_ surprising is the amount of data I've signed over to Facebook in my youth while at the same time balking at the idea of using 3rd party Facebook apps. It goes to show how much trust I had in the platform.

I definitely took for granted the "free" online products such as Facebook, Youtube, Hotmail, LinkedIn, Skype, Google, and so on. Over the past year I've inventoried my online accounts and I'm shocked to find I have over 100, and it's by no means complete. Each recovered account and rotated password was a reminder that my data was eaglerly handed over in exchange for a service I can now barely remember off the top of my head.

## Tunnel vision
By blocking ads and not falling for malware and other traps, I felt like I was "using" the web rather than _being used_ by it. However, the virtual smogasboard of quick content has trained me, and so many others, to skip the T&C and ignore the ramifications of using an online service, especially those provided by for-profit companies.

It also trained me to seek out "junk food" content. Long posts became exercises in skimming, and I often jumped to Reddit's comments section to get a summary of an article and opinions without even reading the article beyond its headline.

Over time, my tunnel vision shrank even more. I became frustrated by the predictable echo chamber of communities like Reddit, and the [reinforcement of algorithmic identity][1] in suggested content across YouTube and Facebook. Without diverse perspectives, I became even more dissatisfied and felt even less at home on the web.

TODO

Unknown to me, there were and still are huge swaths of the web using it in tried and true ways (UNIX, USENET) and new interesting ways (IPFS, scuttlebutt).

## Today's web

There still a gap between my idea of the web and reality. Powerful actors are vying for control.
