# Google's digital wellbeing is product platitude

Among Google's recent product announcements was [Digital Wellbeing][1], a suite of tools and personal assistant features to help manage your time online, enact parental controls, spend less time viewing screens. This may seem counterintuitive to Google's business, or any tech giant that thrives on "engagement" and mindshare.

It's a topical gesture with tech ever-encroaching into our lives, but I think it's little more than a gesture. If anything, these wellbeing products seem at least partially designed to further entrench users in the Google ecosystem and lead us to believe there is no other way. I wouldn't call that _wellbeing_.



I also want to say that these products aren't all bad. I agree with the general premise that techhnology should enrich our lives but not distract from it, and I'm sure there are well-meaning folks at Google and others who aim to help users achieve this balance. But the effort is hamstrung if what's preached is not practiced holistically.
