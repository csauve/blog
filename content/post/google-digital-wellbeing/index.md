# Google's digital wellbeing is product platitude

Among Google's recent product announcements was [Digital Wellbeing][1], a suite of tools and personal assistant features to help manage your time online, enact parental controls, and spend less time viewing screens. My first reaction was that this seemed counterintuitive to Google's business, which thrives on and competes for user "engagement" and mindshare.

It's a topical gesture with tech ever-encroaching into our lives, but I think it's little more than a gesture at Google's scale. If anything, these wellbeing products seem at least partially designed to further entrench users in the Google ecosystem and lead us to believe there is no other way. I wouldn't call that _wellbeing_.

## Google assistant
Use voice controls to send messages, control media, and automate your internet of doodads. Invest some time (and money) into this setup and you'll be spending less time using screens, right? Maybe not. Maybe users will reinvest that time right back into a device, just doing something else. **Is there evidence to back this up?** Without self-enforced controls, voice assistants have the potential to just increase engagement with a platform.

> Great technology should improve life, not distract from it.

I agree with this premise. Technology should enrich our lives and not become the centerpiece. It's the means to an end; it's not the end itself. I also want to say that these products aren't all bad, and I'm sure there are well-meaning folks at Google and others who aim to help users achieve this balance. But the effort is hamstrung if what's preached is not practiced holistically. Let's see how long the commitment sticks.
