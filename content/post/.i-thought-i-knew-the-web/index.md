# I thought I knew the web
<time>2018-04-13</time>

Like many others recently, I am questioning my use of social media. The whole scandal around Cambridge Analytica and Facebook is systemic and hardly surprising, but what _is_ surprising is the amount of data I've signed over to Facebook in my youth while at the same time balking at the idea of using 3rd party Facebook apps. It goes to show how much trust I had in the platform being the "good guys".

My trust went beyond social media. While I could often intuit which sites and apps were untrustworthy, I took for granted the "free" online products such as Facebook, Youtube, Hotmail, LinkedIn, Skype, Google, and so on. Over the past year I've inventoried my online accounts and I'm shocked to find I have over 100, and it's by no means complete. Each recovered account and rotated password was a reminder that my data was eaglerly handed over in exchange for a service I can now barely remember off the top of my head.

## Tunnel vision

It also goes to show I didn't understand the web well. It was far too easy to consume ad-supported products without understanding the ramifications. I blocked the ads, but you bet I didn't read the agreements. Beyond this, I had a sort of web tunnel vision where I visited a slowly shrinking number of favourite websites. I torrented, lurked 4chan, tried Tor, and didn't download malware; it gave me the impression I was a power user who was "using" the web rather than _being used_ by it.

TODO

Oops. Unknown to me, there were and still are huge swaths of the web using it in tried and true ways (UNIX, USENET) and new interesting ways (IPFS, scuttlebutt).

Figured old techs dead; tunnel vision

## Today's web

There still a gap between my idea of the web and reality. Powerful actors are vying for control.
