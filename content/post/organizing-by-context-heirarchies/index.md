# Organizing by context hierarchies
<time>2018-05-25</time>

Do you ever spend far too long wondering where your files should live? Have you fretted over the package layout of a Java project? How about spending hours trying to organize your kitchen to save time later?

No? Must be nice! But if you're like me, you think there's an ideal way to organize everything and that finding it can be frustrating. When there are multiple plausible ways to organize some set of things, you know you won't be satisfied until you've found the _right_ one. I'd like to share my strategy for organization, which I call **group by context** (and not by _type_). But first...

## Why this happens
This might sound a bit obsessive, but the struggle is real! It's also natural. Humans just can't possibly retain the incredible numbers and nuance of things in this world, so we need to generalize and organize to make sense of it. Driven by advancement, we carry this innate need into evermore abstract tasks.

The value of organization is two fold: efficiency in common tasks, and not losing things. Digitally or physically, it's a sort of index we can use to get what we need quickly and ensure we aren't forgetting something. It grows the set of things we can _effectively_ possess, and provides a system to access parts of that collection relevant to the task we're trying to accomplish. The better the organizing, the more tools at our disposal.

Neither a messy storage garage nor a single folder of thousands of images are effective, and must be searched one item at a time. So why do we create these spaces? Hoarding, not necessarily compulsively, could be blamed. Digitally, it's cheap to store vast amounts of data and easy to pack it away into places we don't have to see, a luxury that doesn't exist in the real world.

But what causes a collection to grow into a dump instead of a library, even when we're trying to avoid it? I think this happens when it's too difficult to finding a mental model to organize by, when this model changes over time, or when the means of organization do not match our model.

## Tagging
What about tagging? Lots of software supports it, and it has reasonable analogues in the real world like coloured sticky notes.

I see tagging as a flexible organization strategy, but ultimately infeasible as the collection size grows. Firstly, it's hard to know future use cases for finding an item, but ensuring a useful new tag is applied to old items may require evaluating the entire collection. Like using too many colours of sticky notes to tag pages of a textbook, having too many tags dilutes the meaning of each.

Tagging also breaks down in some physical.

## Contextual hierarchies
Personally I find it easier to organize in a heirarchy, **grouping by context**, and creating sub-hierarchies lazily as needed. In this sense, _context_ means use case for finding and using the item.

Hierarchichal filesystems are a persistent analogy because containers make intuitive sense. Things that are used together can be kept in a container.
