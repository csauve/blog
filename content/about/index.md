# About
I'm Connor Sauve, a software engineer hailing from beautiful Victoria, Canada. I have an interest in projects both technical and creative, plus a love of the outdoors and travel.

During my studies at the _University of Victoria_ I had the pleasure of working co-ops at [AbeBooks.com](http://www.abebooks.com/), [Chris Upton's VBRC Lab](http://athena.bioc.uvic.ca/), and [Helm Operations](http://www.helmoperations.com/). I graduated in 2014 with my BCompSc and returned to *AbeBooks.com*, where I currently specialize in marketplace payments systems.

## t3hz0r?
This blog's name comes from [leetspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) _t3h_ (the) and suffix _-z0r_. For me, its usage came to represent the co-option and transformation of words into the web domain.
