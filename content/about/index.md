# About
I'm Connor Sauve, a software engineer hailing from beautiful Victoria, Canada. I have an interest in things both technical and creative.

During my studies at the _University of Victoria_ I had the pleasure of working co-ops at [AbeBooks.com](http://www.abebooks.com/), [Chris Upton's VBRC Lab](http://athena.bioc.uvic.ca/), and [Helm Operations](http://www.helmoperations.com/).

I graduated in 2014 with my BCompSc and returned to *AbeBooks.com*, where I currently specialize in marketplace payments systems.
