Welcome to my blog! I'm Connor Sauve, a software developer from Victoria, BC with an interest in things both technical and creative. This blog is where I share and document my projects in software, photography, digital art, and gaming. I studied computer science at UVic and did co-ops with [AbeBooks.com](http://www.abebooks.com/), [Chris Upton's VBRC Lab](http://athena.bioc.uvic.ca/), and [Helm Operations](http://www.helmoperations.com/). After graduating in 2014, I returned to work for *AbeBooks.com*. The views expressed on this site do not reflect those of my employer.
