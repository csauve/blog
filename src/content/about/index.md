You've reached my personal site, welcome! I'm Connor Sauve, but I also go by _Conscars_ and _Con_ online. I'm a software developer hailing from Victoria, Canada. I love the outdoors, travel, and anything that combines creativity and tech.

I studied CSC at UVic and did co-ops at [Chris Upton's bioinformatics lab](https://web.uvic.ca/~cupton/), [Helm Operations](https://www.helmoperations.com/), and Amazon subsidiary [AbeBooks.com](https://www.abebooks.com/) where I returned in 2014 and continue to grow my experience in the global e-commerce space.

## t3hz0r?
This blog's name comes from [leetspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) _t3h_ (the) and suffix _-z0r_. For me, its usage came to represent the co-option and transformation of words into the web domain.
